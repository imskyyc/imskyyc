Greetings!

I'm skyyc, Sky, Jaiden, or whatever you'd like to call me! I'm a programmer fluent in five languages including

* PHP
* Python
* Lua
* Java
* and JavaScript

I'm currently in the process of learning the C family of languages, ranging from C/C++ to C#. I hope to one day bring something revolutionary to the various platforms I parttake in, including game engines ranging from Unity to Roblox.

I am most active in Roblox and projects within the [EXILED Framework](https://github.com/Exiled-Team/EXILED) for [SCP Secret Laboratory](https://store.steampowered.com/app/700330/SCP_Secret_Laboratory/).

Here's some statistics about myself. (Got this from [@Parkeymon](https://github.com/Parkeymon) :))
